This is a hello world project for kernel development.

For native compilation just execute the standard makefile with:

"make"

For ARM cross compilation, first run the script to create headerfiles,
(it will ask you for search way to a Linux kernel). Then you invoke the
ARM makefile:

"./createHeaderFiles.bash"
"make -f Makefile.arm"
